study of ancient cultures. The epic and mythological literature
from Ras Shamra, ancient Ugarit on the Phoenician coast, dates
from this period, as do the Nuzi tablets written by Hurrian
scribes in Mitanni. The Ugaritic texts give us an insight into the
language and religious thought of ancient Canaan, and the
archives from Nuzi offer a wealth of information concerning the
social, economic, and legal structure of northern Mesopotamia
in Patriarchal times.</p>
<p>During the Amarna Age the Hittite Empire was pushing
southward from its center in Asia Minor, seeking to incorporate
into its domains both independent states and areas that had
acknowledged Egyptian sovereignty. Minoan Crete had already
reached her highest achievements and was fast approaching her
end. Babylon had already enjoyed a period of prosperity and
power under the great Hammurabi, but she would not again
become a major power for seven centuries&mdash;when Nebuchadnezzar
would lead her to fresh victories. Assyria was soon to
send her armies into Syria and Palestine and challenge Egypt
for control of the East, but she was still a minor power during
the Amarna Age.</p>
<p>The present study is limited to events in Egypt and to Egypt&rsquo;s
political and military relations with her vassals in Syria and
Palestine. The Amarna Tablets are our primary source of information
for Egypt&rsquo;s external affairs, and the artifacts and tomb
inscriptions from Amarna (ancient Akhetaton) help us to
reconstruct life at the court of Akhenaton&mdash;the Pharaoh whose
personality is apparent in every chapter.</p>
<p>The author expresses his indebtedness to the scholars whose
books are listed in the bibliography, and to those organizations
which made available the photographs which are an important
part of the present study. The president and staff of the Baker
Book House have shown every consideration in the planning of
the series, Baker Studies in Biblical Archaeology, and in the
production of this, the second volume.</p>

<br />DISCOVERIES AT AMARNA</h2>
<p>Early in the eighteenth century an Arab tribe known as the
Beni Amran settled in a semicircular plain about one hundred
ninety miles south of Cairo. Here, clustered along the east bank
of the Nile, they built the villages of El Till, El Hag Quandil,
El Amariah and Hawata. When the Danish traveler F. L. Norden
visited the area in 1773 he noted that the natives called it Beni
Amran, or Omarne. The name Tell el Amarna, by which it is
popularly known today, seems to have been coined by John
Gardner Wilkinson, the amateur Egyptologist who did so much
to popularize Egyptian studies in Victorian Britain. Wilkinson
combined the name of the village El Till (altered to the more
common word <i>tell</i>, which means &ldquo;mound&rdquo; in Arabic) with the
tribal name El Amarna, from the Beni Amran. The name Tell
el Amarna is not strictly correct, for the ancient city of Akhetaton
which occupied the site of Amarna does not have a
succession of levels indicating different periods of occupation,
such as archaeologists identify in the mounds of Palestine and
Mesopotamia. Akhetaton was built to be the capital of Pharaoh
Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhenaton, about 1365 B.C.,
and was abandoned half a century later.</p>
<h3>The Beginnings</h3>
<p>Egyptian archaeology gained impetus in modern times following
Napoleon&rsquo;s ill-fated Egyptian campaign. The savants
who accompanied the army of Napoleon studied Egyptian
antiquities and discovered the trilingual inscription known as
the Rosetta Stone which provided scholars with the key to the
decipherment of hieroglyphic writing. That, in turn, enabled
modern students to get a firsthand view of life in ancient Egypt,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
instead of depending on references to Egypt in classical literature
for basic information.</p>
<p>A French scholar, Jean Francois Champollion, studied the
Rosetta Stone in the light of his previous work in Coptic, a
late form of the Egyptian language which used a modified
Greek alphabet. After four years of research, in 1822 Champollion
published his conclusions which provided a firm foundation
for the science of Egyptology which was soon added to the
curricula of the major universities of Europe. Scholars, both
professional and amateur, began making their way to Egypt to
copy inscriptions and study antiquities.</p>
<p>The rock tombs beyond the Amarna plain did not escape
these early travelers. During his explorations in Egypt from
1821 to 1831, John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna, and a
more systematic study of the nearby tombs was made by a
Prussian expedition directed by Karl Richard Lepsius from
1842 to 1845. Amarna art and inscriptions found a place in the
twelve volume work of Lepsius, <i>Denkmaler aus Aegypten und
Athiopien</i> (in English, <i>The Monuments from Egypt and Ethiopia</i>).
The Prussians traced the ground plan of Akhetaton, observing
the lines of its ancient streets. They noted that some of
the remains of the principal temple were still standing.</p>
<h3>The Amarna Tablets</h3>
<p>It was late in 1887, however, before Amarna yielded its most
spectacular treasures, and even then it took some time before
their value was recognized. When mud brick walls decompose,
they form a nitrous soil which the Egyptians have learned to
use as fertilizer. A peasant woman, digging for this fertilizer
among the Amarna ruins, came upon a quantity of small baked
clay tablets bearing cuneiform inscriptions. Some of the tablets
were as small as two and one-eighth by one and eleven-sixteenths
inches, while others were as large as eight and three-quarters
by four and seven-eighth inches. Thousands of such tablets have
been found among the ruins of ancient Sumerian, Assyrian, and
Babylonian cities, where cuneiform was the normal means of
written communication from about 3000 BC, when history
began, until the days of the Persian Empire (550-331 B.C.) when
Aramaic, using an alphabet script, took its place. Cuneiform,
however, seemed strangely out of place in Egypt. The woman
who had accidently come upon the tablets, not knowing their
value, is said to have disposed of her interest in the find
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
for ten piasters&mdash;about fifty cents. The enterprising purchaser
knew that Europeans were paying for antiquities from Egypt
and he sought means of disposing of them at a good price.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="caption">Amarna Tablets from the British Museum. The tablets comprise correspondence between the rulers of the nations and city-states of western Asia and the Egyptian Pharaohs Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton).</p>
</div>
<p>An antiquities dealer showed wisdom in sending several of
the texts to a noted Assyriologist, Jules Oppert of Paris, doubtless
thinking that Oppert might encourage the Louvre to purchase
them. Oppert had had extensive experience in archaeological
work in the Near East. He had directed a French expedition
at Babylon in 1852, and had subsequently been active
in the work of deciphering cuneiform inscriptions. When Jules
Oppert saw the Amarna tablets, however, he summarily dismissed
them as forgeries. The story that they had been found
in Egypt may have been too much for him to take. Tablets
were also sent to the head of the Egyptian Department of
Antiquities, G. M. E. Grebaut, but he ventured no opinion concerning
their worth. Perhaps he, too, was puzzled at the thought
of cuneiform inscriptions in Egypt.</p>
<p>Since the authorities had shown no interest in the tablets,
many of them were dumped into sacks and carried by donkey
to Luxor with the hope that dealers there might be able to
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
dispose of them through sale to tourists. In the process of
transportation many of the tablets were literally ground to bits.
Those that survived may be but a small fraction of the original
archive.</p>
<p>Chauncey Murch, an American missionary stationed at Luxor,
learned about the tablets and suspected they might be of real
value. He, along with friendly antiquities dealers, brought them
to the attention of E. A. Wallis Budge, Keeper of the Egyptian
and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum, who happened
to be in Egypt at the time for the purpose of adding to the
museum collection. Budge was enthusiastic with what he saw,
although he was by no means the only one who had come to
realize that these little lumps of baked clay would be of inestimable
value to the linguist and the historian of the ancient
East. Although we have no way of knowing exactly how many
of the tablets were irretrievably damaged or destroyed, about
three hundred and fifty were preserved, and later discoveries
increased the total number of Amarna tablets in the various
collections to about four hundred.</p>
<p>Budge would have purchased the entire lot for the British
Museum, but the tablets were in the hands of several dealers,
some of whom had made agreements with an agent of the Berlin
Museum for the sale of antiquities. As a result the British Museum
and the Berlin Museum each acquired collections of
Amarna Tablets, and smaller quantities went elsewhere. Budge
acquired eighty-two for the British Museum and Theodore Graf
of Vienna purchased about one hundred and eighty tablets
which were sold to J. Simon of Berlin for presentation to the
museum. The Berlin collection was subsequently increased to
over two hundred. Sixty of the tablets remained in Cairo, twenty-two
from a later discovery went to the Ashmolean Museum at
Oxford, and the remainder are scattered among other museums
and private collections. The Louvre has six, two are in the
Metropolitan Museum in New York City, and one is in the
Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>In 1892, Frederick J. Bliss, while excavating Tell el Hesi in
southern Palestine discovered a cuneiform tablet which mentions
a name known from the Amarna tablets. It evidently dates
from the Amarna period. At Taanach, five miles southeast of
Megiddo in northern Palestine, Ernst Sellin discovered four more
letters in 1903. They date in the fifteenth century B.C., about
three generations before the bulk of the Amarna tablets. As
late as the winter of 1933-34, members of the Egyptian Exploration
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Society discovered eight additional tablets at the original
site. Six of these were school texts and exercises used by students
in the local academy where Egyptians were taught to read and
write Akkadian.</p>
<p>Several of the Amarna tablets contain lists of signs and items
of vocabulary. Others are practice copies of such Akkadian
myths as <i>Adapa and the South Wind</i>, <i>Ereshkigal and Nergal</i>,
and the <i>King of Battle</i> epic. Most, however, comprise the diplomatic
correspondence of the Egyptian Foreign Office during the
reigns of Amenhotep III and IV (Akhenaton). The archives
included letters to and from Babylon (13 items), Assyria (2),
Mitanni (13), Alashia (=Cyprus?) (8), the Hittites (at least
1). Two letters, written in a Hittite dialect, probably involve
the king of Arzawa, a region along the southern coast of Asia
Minor. One letter is written to the kings of Canaan demanding
safe passage of a messenger who is on his way to Egypt. Another
is a letter from a Babylonian princess to the Egyptian ruler. Most
of the rest&mdash;actually about four-fifths of the whole collection&mdash;are
letters to and from the rulers of city-states of Canaan
(<i>Kinahni</i>), a name applying in general to Palestine, Syria, and
Phoenicia; and the Amorites (<i>Amurru</i>) of Lebanon. This extensive
correspondence enables us to reconstruct the political
history of the Near East during the fifteenth and fourteenth
centuries B.C., a period frequently called the Amarna Age.
While neither the Egyptian Pharaohs nor the rulers of Canaanite
city-states used Akkadian as their mother tongue, it served as the
language of diplomacy among people with varied ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Excavations at Amarna</h3>
<p>With the recognition of the nature and value of the Amarna
texts, attention naturally turned to the place where they were
discovered. In 1891 W. Flinders Petrie, who had already spent
a decade in Egypt, began excavating the Amarna ruins. He
cleared many of the official buildings in the center of the city,
and several houses farther south. Near the village of El Till he
discovered the painted pavements of Akhenaton&rsquo;s palace, and
remains of the ornamental decorations of the palace itself. To
the east of the palace was the chamber in which the Foreign
Office records were kept. This was where the first Amarna Tablets
were discovered in 1887, and here Petrie uncovered twenty-two
additional fragments which comprise the collection now in
the Ashmolean Museum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>From 1907 until the outbreak of World War I, a German
expedition under the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft began the
systematic excavation of the Amarna ruins. After several trial
digs they undertook the excavation of the southern end of the
site (1911), progressing northward along the ancient thoroughfare
known as High Priest Street. The most impressive discovery
of these years was the studio which belonged to the sculptor
Thutmose, which contained some of the finest specimens of
ancient Egyptian art. The famed painted limestone bust of
Nofretete was the work of Thutmose. The studio also contained
excellent heads of Akhenaton, and of the young princesses who
graced the royal household.</p>
<p>The sculptures and rock tombs, first described by Wilkinson
and Lepsius, were subjected to vandalism by peasants who
found that they could make money by chipping off sections of
the inscriptions and selling them as antiquities. Fortunately this
was halted by action of the Egyptian government, and a definitive
study of the tombs was made by the Mission Archeologique
Francaise and the Egypt Exploration Fund. The results were
published in a definitive six volume work, <i>The Rock Tombs of
El Amarna</i> by N. deGaris Davies from 1903 to 1908.</p>
<p>Since World War I, archeological work at Amarna has been
the responsibility of the Egypt Exploration Society. T. Eric Peet
and Leonard Woolley conducted a series of campaigns beginning
in 1921 during which they continued the work of the
Germans at the southern section of the town. They excavated
the pleasure palace known as Meru Aton and much of the walled
village inhabited by the ancient workmen who labored in the
rock tombs east of the city. Tomb chapels were excavated north
of the workmen&rsquo;s village, and a sanctuary known as the River
Temple was discovered in the village of El Hag Qandil.</p>
<p>During the 1923-24 campaign, F. G. Newton and F. Llewellyn
Griffith continued work in the southern sector and began excavation
of the North Palace, north of El Till. The following
season, following Newton&rsquo;s death, Thomas Whittemore completed
work at the North Palace and adjacent structures. From
1926 to 1929 the work was directed by Henri Frankfort who
continued excavating in the north and gave particular attention
to work in the neighborhood of the Great Temple. John D. S.
Pendlebury, who took over direction of the work in 1930, completed
excavations in the north. In a series of campaigns between
1931 and 1937, Pendlebury directed work on the official
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
quarters of the central city, including the palace and the Great
Temple.</p>
<p>Archaeological work was concluded at Amarna in 1937. The
site had great advantages, for it was the one city of Egypt which
was never rebuilt. Most of our knowledge of ancient Egypt
comes from discoveries in desert tombs, for ancient cities were
usually replaced by modern cities on the same site. Akhetaton,
however, was the sacred city of a Pharaoh whom later generations
despised as a criminal; and after his death its significance
was at an end. Just because it was not rebuilt centuries ago,
today it yields an impressive picture of the times of Akhenaton.</p>

<h2 id="c2">II
<br />THE RESTLESS PHARAOH</h2>
<p>Although Pharaohs of the third millenium B.C. exploited Sinai
copper mines, and Middle Kingdom rulers sent trading expeditions
to Punt on the African coast, opposite Aden, Egypt alone
was considered to be a civilized land and foreigners could be
dismissed as uncouth barbarians. Egypt lived in splendid isolation,
annoyed at times by Semites who had infiltrated the fertile
Nile Valley since prehistoric times, but never seriously involved
in life beyond her borders. Her land appeared to be particularly
favored of the gods, and the Egyptian could not think of it
otherwise.</p>
<p>Yet the blessings of life along the Nile did not insure to Egypt
a government that could meet challenges from without and
guarantee peace and prosperity within the Nile Valley and Delta.
By about 1700 B.C., Egypt experienced the weakening of central
authority which permitted the invading Hyksos (&ldquo;rulers of
foreign lands&rdquo;) to seize control of the country and establish
their own dynasty. The prosperous Middle Kingdom was at
an end, and the hard hand of alien rule was evident throughout
the land. It was not until 1570 B.C. that Ahmose, founder of
the Eighteenth Dynasty, succeeded in driving the Hyksos back
into Asia and establishing native control over Egypt.</p>
<h3>The New Kingdom</h3>
<p>The Hyksos invasion left one lesson: Never again could
Egypt adopt a policy of isolation. The best defense is offense.
As Asiatic Hyksos rulers had marched upon Egypt, so Egypt
would march her armies into Asia. Thutmose I (1525-1494 B.C.)
campaigned successfully in Asia, and under Thutmose III (1490-1435
B.C.) western Asia was brought under the control of
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Egyptian arms. During his seventeen campaigns in Palestine and
Syria, Thutmose III took Megiddo in the Valley of Esdraelon
and Carchemish on the Euphrates. Egyptian authority extended
from the Sudan to the Euphrates, and the reigning Pharaoh was
suzerain of Syria and Palestine. The king list at Karnak lists
one hundred nineteen towns taken by Thutmose III. Often
the Egyptians were content to allow a native prince to remain
in power as long as he was willing to provide tribute and manpower
to the Egyptian commissioner. Important cities were ruled
directly by an Egyptian governor.</p>
<p>In theory the Pharaoh was a god with absolute power whose
word was law. The Egyptians have left us no law codes, and it
may be that they sensed no need of such codified law as we
find in Sumer, Babylon, Assyria, and among the Hittites (as well
as the Biblical Hebrews). The presence of a living god in the
land might render such written codes unnecessary.</p>
<p>In practice, however, as Egypt extended her Empire the
personal involvement of the Pharaoh became progressively less.
The priesthood of Amon-Re, god of Thebes and chief god of
the Egyptian pantheon, developed enormous power. Before any
important decision it was expected that the Pharaoh would consult
the oracle of Amon-Re. Hundreds of civil servants were
required to care for the needs of a great Empire, and most of
these were drawn from a few powerful families. The result was a
bureaucracy which, like the priesthood, could serve as a power
block. The army, and particularly its commander, was a third
factor that could not be ignored by Egyptian officialdom. While
the Pharaoh was theoretically the head of church and state&mdash;god
and king in Egypt&mdash;in practice he might find himself frustrated
at every turn by religious, civil, and military bureaucracies.</p>
<p>From the campaigns of Thutmose III until late in the reign
of Amenhotep III (<i>ca.</i> 1360 B.C.) the Egyptian Empire seems
to have functioned with maximum efficiency. The riches of
Nubia, Crete, western Asia, and even distant Mycenae poured
into Thebes, the Egyptian capital. A Mitannian princess graced
the harem of Thutmose IV (1414-1406 B.C.). Amenhotep III
caused his name and that of his wife to be cut into a group of
scarabs with the inscription, &ldquo;She is the wife of the victorious
king whose territory in the south reaches to Karei (=Napata,
at the Fourth Cataract of the Nile) and on the north to Naharin
(=Mitanni).&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Amenhotep III. The brown quartzite head depicts the Pharaoh with an enigmatic smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Amenhotep III was responsible for the immense colonnades
at Luxor and a great funerary temple which has disappeared
except for two immense seated statues of the Pharaoh now
known as the Colossi of Memmon (supposedly representing an
Ethiopian hero who fell on the battlefield at Troy). Although
the harem of Amenhotep III included daughters from the kings
of Mitanni, Assyria, Babylon, and the Hittites, he was devoted to
his wife Tiy for whom he built an artificial lake a mile long
and over a thousand feet wide south of the Medinet Habu
temple.</p>
<p>The decline in Egyptian power may be traced to the latter
half of the reign of Amenhotep III. While the Pharaoh was sick,
his wife Tiy seems to have exercised considerable power. The
balance of power in Asia was upset by the rise of Suppiluliumas
(1375-1340 B.C.), a Hittite ruler who sought to carve out an
empire for himself. Egypt avoided military action, with the
result that the loyal princes were left to defend themselves or
make their own terms with the enemy.</p>
<h3>Young Amenhotep IV</h3>
<p>When Amenhotep III died he was succeeded by his eleven
year old son Amenhotep IV (1370-1353 B.C.), and the queen
mother Tiy continued to act as regent. In addition to the influence
of his mother, young Amenhotep IV was educated by
the priest, Eye, who was the husband of his childhood nurse. No
doubt Amenhotep was early married to the fair Nofretete
who may have been his sister. Brother-sister marriages were
common in ancient Egypt, but we cannot be certain concerning
the parentage of Nofretete. Under the tutelage of his mother,
his wife, and a favored priest, young Amenhotep could hardly
be expected to have developed an interest in military affairs.
His interest turned toward religion and, in the words of Breasted,
&ldquo;the philosophizing theology of the priests was of more importance
to him than all the provinces of Asia.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Amenhotep IV is depicted as having a thin face, narrow sloping
shoulders, and unusually large hips and abdomen. His skull
seems to have been deformed, and he may have been an epileptic.
These handicaps did not affect his mind, however, for he
was one of history&rsquo;s creative thinkers. Breasted (with considerable
hyperbole, to be sure), calls him &ldquo;the first individual in
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
human history.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Unfortunately the international tensions of the
day were such that Egypt needed a warrior rather than a philosopher
king. The idealism of Amenhotep IV was largely lost on his
own generation, and entirely lost on the generation that followed
him.</p>
<p>Nofretete was devoted both to her husband and to the religious
reforms to which he dedicated his life. She bore him
six daughters and appears to have been her husband&rsquo;s constant
companion and confidant. Nofretete was, understandably, a
favored subject in Amarna art. Reliefs depict her playing with
her daughters, and one shows her seated on her husband&rsquo;s knee,
blowing him a kiss at a chariot procession.</p>
<p>During the early years of his reign, Amenhotep IV clearly
favored the god Aton, but he was tolerant of the various deities
worshiped in Egypt. In this he continued the policy of his
father, Amenhotep III, and his mother, Queen Tiy. The preference
for the god Aton is evident in the name of the first child
of Amenhotep IV, Merit-aton (&ldquo;Beloved of Aton&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The priests of Amon in Thebes must have looked with apprehension
upon the youthful Pharaoh whose devotion to the chief
god of Egypt seemed to be compromised by religious innovation.
We can only guess their reaction when Amenhotep IV decided
to build a temple to Aton within the sacred precincts of
the city of Amon. Orders were given to quarry sandstone at the
Silsila quarries, forty miles north of Aswan. Here a monument
was erected to mark the beginning of the quarrying operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First occurrence of His Majesty&rsquo;s giving command to muster all
the workmen from Elephantine to Samhudet, and the leaders
of the army, in order to make a great breach for cutting out sandstone,
in order to make the sanctuary of Harakhti in his name,
&ldquo;Heat which is in Aton,&rdquo; in Karnak. Behold the officials, the
companions, and the chiefs of the fan bearers were the chiefs of
the quarry service for the transportation of stone.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amenhotep IV was twenty-one when he created the Aton
temple at Thebes. He was still attempting to form a synthesis
of old and new elements in his religious faith, for the old god
Re-Harakhti of Heliopolis is identified with Aton. The Silsila
stele depicts Amenhotep IV worshiping Amon, yet it also shows
Aton (the sun) with rays of light which hold the Egyptian sign
of life (<i>ankh</i>). Amon, Re-Harakhti, and Aton all figure in the
Silsila stele.</p>

<p class="caption">Akhenaton and Nofretete. A limestone plaque from Akhetaton depicts the Pharaoh and his beautiful wife.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Break with Amon</h3>
<p>Amenhotep IV, however, was unable to stop with half-way
measures. In his devotion to Aton he felt that his god alone was
worthy of worship. The Theban temple area was renamed, &ldquo;The
Brightness of the Great Aton,&rdquo; and the city itself became, &ldquo;The
City of the Brightness of Aton.&rdquo; In an obvious break with the
past, Amenhotep IV determined to change his own name, which
meant &ldquo;Amon is satisfied&rdquo; to Akhenaton, meaning, &ldquo;he who is
serviceable to Aton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time on, Akhenaton&rsquo;s zeal knew no bounds. He
banished the mention of Re-Harakhti from the descriptive title
of Aton, and had the very names of Amon and the Egyptian
pantheon chiseled out of the monuments at Thebes. The Amon
temples were closed, and Atonism became the only sanctioned
religion of Egypt. The reform, however, did not have a popular
base, and it probably did not penetrate far beyond the royal
family and retainers. Akhenaton, like the earlier Pharaohs, believed
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
in his own divinity, esteeming himself the son of Aton.
As such he would be worshiped by his faithful subjects.</p>

The uraeus is a stylized representation of an enraged female cobra, poised as though prepared to strike an enemy.</p>
</div>
<p>The reasons for Akhenaton&rsquo;s break with the religious traditions
of his day are complex. In part the revolt certainly represents
the desire of a young Pharaoh to free himself from the yoke
of a firmly entrenched priestly class. Yet the break was far more
than an act of political expediency. The influence of the priesthood
of Heliopolis, perennial rivals of the Theban priests, and
the development of Atonism in the years preceding his accession
to the throne are all factors that cannot be overlooked. Perhaps
the &ldquo;petticoat government&rdquo; into which he moved at the age of
eleven with the strong influence of his mother, Queen Tiy, had
something to do with it. There may even be a measure of compensation
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
for physical inadequacies in the vigorous measures
he took to establish Aton as the sole god of Egypt. Whatever
historical or psychological motivations may be suggested, Akhenaton&rsquo;s
whole life gives evidence of the fact that he was
piously devoted to Aton, the god whose beneficent rays bring
life to all mankind.</p>
<p>While the priests of Amon were bitterly antagonistic to
Akhenaton, he found allies in the priests from Memphis who
had long resented the dominating position of the Theban priesthood.
The army was divided. Conservative elements sided with
the Theban priests, but a bright young general, Horemhab, saw
in Akhenaton&rsquo;s revolt an opportunity for personal advancement
and threw in his lot with the new king. There is a suggestion
that a counter revolution was planned, for the Amon priests
claimed that the Pharaoh had abandoned his people, and was
himself abandoned by his father Amon.</p>
<h3>The New Capital</h3>
<p>Akhenaton did abandon Thebes. As tensions grew he came
to realize that his new faith could not flourish in the city of
Amon. There were theological reasons, too, for Aton had no city
that was distinctly dedicated to his worship. Akhenaton decided
to build a new capital, dedicated to the god Aton, with the
name Akhetaton, &ldquo;the horizon of Aton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The move to Akhetaton, modern Amarna, three hundred miles
north of Thebes, must have been welcome both to Akhenaton&rsquo;s
court and the Theban priesthood. The city seems to have been
built in haste, and when Akhenaton left Thebes it was for good.
Was life at Akhetaton all that Akhenaton envisioned? The inscriptions
and the paintings from the rock tombs suggest that
the royal family enjoyed a few happy years in devotion to Aton
and to one another. True, the envoys from distant lands and
subject peoples noted the growing gulf between Akhenaton and
the people, and the empire suffered as the Egyptian Pharaoh
lived in the seclusion of his capital. Tragedy entered the lives of
Akhenaton and Nofretete when their second daughter Meketaton
died and was buried in the family tomb east of Akhetaton.</p>
<h3>The End of an Era</h3>
<p>The closing years of the lives of Nofretete and Akhenaton are
largely a blank. Their third daughter Meritaton married Smenkhkare,
a young architect who was much favored by Akhenaton
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and occupied the throne for a short time after his death. Another
daughter Ankhsenpaton, married Tutankhaton, a loyal follower
of her father. His brief reign left no impress on Egyptian history.
The discovery of his tomb, however, in the Valley of the Kings,
has made him the best known of all Pharaohs.</p>

<p class="caption">Princess Manyet-aton. A representation of the princess was adapted for use as the lid of a canopic jar used in the burial of Akhenaton. Discovered in the tomb of Smenkhkare in the Valley of the Kings, Thebes.</p>
</div>
<p>The circumstances concerning the deaths of Nofretete and
Akhenaton are not known, although we do know that Akhenaton
died in the seventeenth year of his reign, when he was but
thirty years of age. Atonism did not long survive its most loyal
adherents. Meritaton became Meritamon, and the famed King
Tut is known by his later name, Tutankhamon, rather than the
earlier Tuntankhaton. In many ways Akhenaton seems to have
been a man whose life was a failure. All for which he stood was
quickly obliterated during the scant generation after his death.
Yet this judgment is too hasty. Even the priests of Amon could
not wholly turn back the reforms in art and literature which
Akhenaton encouraged. While such terms as &ldquo;monotheist&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pacifist&rdquo; when applied to him bear a different connotation from
their meaning in contemporary life, still his meditation upon
the Aton bringing blessing to all men has within it the seed of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
something that finds its highest expression in the prophetic
spokesmen of ancient Israel. Akhenaton went too far for his
own generation in Egypt, but the Biblical affirmation of God
as creator of heaven and earth and redeemer of mankind was
hardly apprehended by Akhenaton.</p>

<h2 id="c3">III
<br />THE HORIZON OF ATON</h2>
<p>When Akhenaton determined to build a new city which would
be sacred to his god Aton, he chose a site on the east bank of
the Nile, three hundred miles north of Thebes, where the flanking
cliffs recede to leave a semicircular plain eight miles long and
three broad. Here Akhenaton built the capital city which he
named Akhetaton, &ldquo;the horizon of Aton.&rdquo; The city itself was
five miles long but only about eleven hundred yards broad. It
had no walls, for the Nile formed its western boundary and a
semicircle of cliffs bound it on the east. The fertile land along
the river bank was kept for cultivation.</p>
<h3>The Boundaries of Akhetaton</h3>
<p>Akhenaton and his wife Nofretete personally chose the site of
Akhetaton and supervised the erection of the stelae which
marked its boundaries. In all, fourteen of these markers have
been found on the hillsides east and west of the Nile. They
contain a longer and a shorter version of the ceremony by which
the site was consecrated. The shorter version tells how, on the
eighth month of the sixth year of Akhenaton&rsquo;s reign, he mounted
his golden chariot and journeyed northward from the richly
ornamented tent where he had passed the night to fix the limits
of the projected city of Akhetaton. After sacrificing to his god,
Aton, he drove southward to a spot where the rays of the sun
shining on him indicated where the southern boundary should
be located. Here he swore an oath by his father Aton, and by
his hope that the queen and his two (elder) daughters would
attain old age, that he would never pass beyond this boundary,
and beyond two more on the east bank and three on the west
bank. All land within that area belonged to Aton, and should
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
any damage befall the stelae marking it, he would make it good.
Mention is made of a renewal of the oath in the eighth year.</p>
<p>The longer version adds some details. It tells how Akhenaton
called his courtiers and military commanders, explaining to
them Aton&rsquo;s wish that Akhetaton be built. Aton alone knew the
site, and it is his alone. The courtiers reply that all countries will
send gifts to Aton. Akhenaton praises his god and vows that he
will never extend the city&rsquo;s boundaries, nor allow his wife to
persuade him to do so. Then he enumerates the sanctuaries he
will build at Akhetaton, ending with a reference to his family
tomb.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The pledge never to extend the boundaries of Akhetaton is
puzzling. It seems to be a concession to the Amon priesthood
that he will limit Aton&rsquo;s holdings to the few miles of territory in
the region of present day Amarna. On the other hand the pledge
may be merely the legal phrase used by a property owner to
indicate that he has no rights beyond his own boundaries.</p>
<h3>The Move to the New Capital</h3>
<p>It probably took at least two years to build Akhetaton. It was
during the sixth year of Akhenaton&rsquo;s reign that he ordered all
Egyptians and subject peoples&mdash;Nubians and Asiatics&mdash;to serve
Aton alone. Statues of the old gods were ordered destroyed;
their reliefs were to be erased, and their names blotted out. Two
years later&mdash;Akhenaton&rsquo;s eighth&mdash;the transfer of the capital
from Thebes to Akhetaton was complete.</p>
<p>There are evidences of great haste in the construction of the
buildings. Often naturalistic pictures of birds and vegetation
painted on plaster walls and floors cover shoddy workmanship.
Houses were built of mud brick, but palaces and temples were
built of stone. An inscription attributed to the architect Bek at
Aswan states that stone was quarried there &ldquo;for the great
and mighty monuments of the king in the house of Aton in
Akhetaton.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Plan of the City</h3>
<p>Paralleling the Nile, the city had three north-south streets
which crossed the more numerous east-west streets at right
angles. The principal north-south street, the King&rsquo;s Way, served
the city&rsquo;s more important buildings. At its southern end was the
pleasure palace, Meru Aton, with its artificial pools, flower
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
beds, and groves of trees. Meru Aton is thought to have served
as a summer palace. It had a reception hall, a small chamber,
guard houses, and various other buildings. The inner rooms
were gaily decorated with colored columns and pavements
painted with flying birds, playing animals, and a variety of
plant life.</p>
<p>Farther north the King&rsquo;s Way passed between the palace and
the royal house, where it was spanned by a bridge. In the
center of the bridge was the &ldquo;window of appearing&rdquo; where the
royal family appeared on special occasions to greet the populace
assembled on the street below. The palace was fourteen hundred
feet long and four to five hundred feet wide, with an impressive
hall of pillars. The pavements of painted stucco, discovered by
Flinders Petrie during his expedition at Amarna in 1891, were
maliciously destroyed by a disgruntled guard in 1912, and the
portions that were salvaged are now in the Cairo Museum. The
royal house was a vast walled compound containing the king&rsquo;s
apartment, a nursery for the princesses, and vast gardens and
storehouses. The rooms were ornamented with colorful paintings
and inlays of colored stone.</p>
<p>Beyond the palace, the King&rsquo;s Way passed the spiritual center
of the royal city, the Great Temple to Aton, comprising a series
of open courts and halls, connected by pylons in which altars
were set up to receive offerings. The chief altar was located in
the center of the largest court. Here Akhenaton, usually accompanied
by Nofretete, offered prayers and consecrated offerings
to Atom. Throughout the city there were numerous smaller
shrines built to honor the kings of Egypt&rsquo;s past, or to serve
members of the royal family. Nofretete presided at a shrine with
the colorful name, &ldquo;The House of Putting the Aton to Rest.&rdquo;
The queen mother Tiy had a temple, and there were shrines for
Baktaton, the king&rsquo;s younger sister, and Meritaton, his oldest
daughter. Shrines were built in memory of Amenhotep II and
Thutmose IV.</p>
<p>Beyond the Great Temple, the King&rsquo;s Way becomes the main
street of modern El Till. It disappears for a time in the fields,
but emerges at the North Palace which had walls decorated
with lively paintings of bird life in a papyrus swamp. A royal
aviary and a zoo were part of the palace complex. After another
break, the lines of the ancient King&rsquo;s Way appear again
in the northern city with its numerous mansions.</p>
<p>A second important north-south thoroughfare is High Priest
Street from which the estates of many of the nobles in Akhenaton&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
court could be entered. The standard of living was one of
luxury, for the houses of the nobles contained large reception
halls, living rooms, and bedrooms. Each had a well-kept garden,
at one end of which an avenue of trees led to a pool. Besides
the spacious living quarters there were separate buildings to
serve as stables for the flocks and herds belonging to the family,
storage buildings, and servant&rsquo;s quarters. The largest such estate,
belonging to the vizier Nakht, measured ninety-five by eighty-five
feet.</p>
<p>Interspersed among these palatial homes were humbler cottages,
belonging to the working class, each of which had a
front hall, a living room, bedroom, and kitchen. Every house&mdash;both
of nobles and of commoners&mdash;had a bathroom with running
water and a lavatory. There was evidently no conscious
city planning, for it seems that the nobles laid claim to extensive
patches of land, only to surrender parts of their property to
commoners at a later time. Perhaps unintentionally, Akhetaton
has marks of democracy in this mixture of ruling and working
classes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="caption">The Estate of a Nobleman. The model of the estate of one of Akhenaton&rsquo;s nobles at Akhetaton. Restoration by Seton Lloyd.</p>
</div>
<p>The officials of Akhetaton were for the most part new appointments
of the king, and many seem to have been chosen
from among commoners who were sympathetic with Akhenaton&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
program. The mayor of the city bore the revealing name, &ldquo;Akhenaton
created me.&rdquo; Other officials include a captain of police,
an overseer of the treasury, the king&rsquo;s standard bearer, the commander
of the army, overseers of the royal harem, the chief
physician, and priests of the various temples. Eye, who had been
a counselor of Akhenaton from boyhood, bore the impressive
title, &ldquo;Superintendent of the King&rsquo;s Horses,&rdquo; implying a responsibility
for the chariots of the royal army. Second only to Akhenaton
himself was the vizier, a man named Nakht. A royal butler,
Parennufe, was one of the few officials who had served Akhenaton
earlier in Thebes.</p>
<h3>The Rock Tombs</h3>
<p>The third north-south street was the East Road, located nearest
to the desert and the rock tombs. As the earlier Pharaohs in
Thebes prepared tombs for themselves in the nearby Valley of
the Kings, so Akhenaton and his courtiers cut rock tombs into
the hillside east of Akhetaton. There are twenty-five of these
tombs with decorated walls honoring Aton and his son, Akhenaton.
Davies in his <i>Rock Tombs of El Amarna</i> says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scenes in the tombs of El-&rsquo;Amarna, though abundant and
detailed, yield us very limited information concerning men and
things in Akhetaten. Taken together, they only reveal one personality,
one family, one home, one career, and one mode of
worship. This is the figure, family, palace and occupations of
the king, and the worship of the sun&mdash;which also was his, and
perhaps, in strictness, of no one else. Into whatever tomb we
enter, as soon as the threshold is past we might fancy ourselves
in the royal sepulchre. The king&rsquo;s figure, family, and retinue
dominate everything. It is his wife and children, his family
affection, his house and treasures which are here portrayed in
detail, and it is with difficulty sometimes that we discover among
the crowd of courtiers the official whose tomb it is, distinguished
by a little hieroglyphic label.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The family tomb which Akhenaton built in the eastern desert,
four miles from the city, was used for the burial of his daughter,
the princess Meketaton. Most of the rock tombs, however, were
never occupied. Within a short time of the death of Akhenaton,
his capital was abandoned and Thebes again became the
center of government. Everything of value was removed from
Akhetaton&mdash;even the wooden pillars of the houses! The very
stones of the Aton temple were dragged away to be used in the
reconstruction of temples desecrated in the days of Akhenaton&rsquo;s
reform movement. Thus the priests of Amon had their revenge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV
<br />ATONISM</h2>
<p>Akhenaton thought of himself as the apostle of Atonism, and
he exhibited a mystical devotion to his god. Yet Akhenaton was
not the founder of the Aton cult, which may be traced to antecedents
in Egypt&rsquo;s earliest religious traditions.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> The Sinuhe
story, recounting the death of Amenemhet I (<i>ca.</i> 1960 B.C.),
states that the deceased Pharaoh ascended to heaven and was
united to the disk of the sun (<i>itn</i>). While this may mean only
that the sun disk was the abode of deity, it suggests the possibility
that the Aton (sun disk) might itself become an object of
worship.</p>
<h3>Ancient Egyptian Religion</h3>
<p>The Egyptian religion of historical times represents a fusion
of previously independent local gods. Each town was devoted
to a particular deity, many of whom were represented in the
form of animals. The cat goddess Bast was honored at Bubastis;
the cobra-headed Edjo, at Buto; the ibis Thoth, at Hermopolis
Magna; and the jackal god Wepwawet, at Lycopolis. Animal
deities were frequently given the bodies and limbs of humans.</p>
<p>The sun and the Nile River were the two important factors in
the life of all Egyptians, and gods associated with these phenomena
tended to transcend Egyptian provincialism and become
truly national in scope. The priests at Heliopolis, near ancient
Memphis, were devoted to the worship of the sun god under
his ancient name Re. Heliopolis (&ldquo;city of the sun&rdquo;) is the Greek
form of a name that appears in the Old Testament in transliteration
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
from the Egyptian as On (cf. Gen. 41:45ff.) and as Hebrew,
Beth-Shemesh, &ldquo;House of the sun&rdquo; (Jer. 43:13). Joseph was
married to an Egyptian girl named Asenath, &ldquo;she belongs to
(the goddess) Neith,&rdquo; the daughter of a priest named Potiphera
(&ldquo;He whom Re has given&rdquo;) who ministered at the shrine to the
sun god at On, or Heliopolis (Gen. 41:45, 50; 46:20).</p>
<p>Re as the sun god came to be associated with other deities. As
Re-Atum he came to be regarded as a manifestation of Atum,
the creator. As god of the horizon, Re took the compound name
Re-Harakhti. Such compounds as Sobek-Re and Khnum-Re indicate
the tendency to identify local deities with the more universal
Re. Beginning with the Fifth Dynasty (<i>ca.</i> 2500 B.C.)
each Pharaoh bore the title &ldquo;Son of Re&rdquo; as part of his name,
further enhancing the name and reputation of the sun god. Until
the Egyptian New Kingdom (<i>ca.</i> 1600-1100 B.C.), when
Amon of Thebes became the principal god of Egypt, the priests
of Re at Heliopolis shared with the priests of Ptah in nearby
Memphis the position of highest influence and wealth in the
religious life of the country.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i10.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="623" />
<p class="caption">Hapi, God of the Nile. The Nile god is depicted on a relief from the throne of the Pharaoh Eye.</p>
</div>
<p>As creator god, Re was symbolized by the falcon and the
scarab. The sun&rsquo;s daily journey across the sky reminded the devout
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
Egyptian of Re&rsquo;s first appearance as the originator of life.
Re, himself, was self-created according to the Book of the Dead.
In Middle Kingdom times (<i>ca.</i> 2000-1600 B.C.), Thebes became
the Egyptian capital and its patron deity Amon was identified
with the sun god and assumed the compound name &ldquo;Amon-Re,
king of the gods.&rdquo; Thus a purely local god, through identification
with Re, became the national god. As local gods became
identified with one another, or with more universal gods, we
may observe a tendency in the direction of monotheism.</p>
<h3>Aton Worship</h3>
<p>The worship of Aton appears as early as the reign of Thutmose
IV (<i>ca.</i> 1414-1406 B.C.), who issued a commemorative scarab
stating that the Pharaoh fought &ldquo;with the Aton before him,&rdquo; and
that he campaigned abroad, &ldquo;to make the foreigners to be like
the (Egyptian) people, in order to serve the Aton forever.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Aton occupied an important place in the Egyptian pantheon
during the reign of Akhenaton&rsquo;s father, Amenhotep III. A stele of
the king&rsquo;s architects, Hori and Suti, describes the sun god as
the deity who holds sway over all peoples and lands. A hymn
speaks of Amon as &ldquo;Aton of the day, creator of mortals and
maker of life.&rdquo; The royal barge of Amenhotep III and his wife
Tiy bore the name, &ldquo;Aton gleams.&rdquo; Other gods were worshiped,
and Amon was still in his place of honor, but Aton had come to
the fore&mdash;perhaps in a context of rivalry between the priests of
Heliopolis and Thebes&mdash;and the stage was set for the impending
battle.</p>
<p>In the earliest period of Akhenaton&rsquo;s reign, Aton was the preferred
god, but Amon was still granted homage. There was
actually little that was original in the religious life of those
earliest years, although there was much that might give concern
to the Amon priests. Although there had been an earlier Aton
temple in Thebes, it was Akhenaton who slowly moved from a
position in which Aton was the favored god to one in which
Aton was the only god tolerated. While there had been tendencies
toward monotheism before, and Aton worship was not new,
it was Akhenaton who finally made the break with the Amon
priests at Thebes. With inexorable logic he changed his name
from Amenhotep to Akhenaton, closed the Amon temples, and
erased the name of Amon from monuments and inscriptions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
While Amon was the particular object of his disfavor, Akhenaton
declared war on all the &ldquo;thousand gods of Egypt,&rdquo; and sought
to remove the very word &ldquo;gods&rdquo; from the monuments.</p>
<h3>The Triumph of Aton</h3>
<p>Aton became the only object of worship tolerated by the
Pharaoh, and his domain was extended beyond the boundaries
of Egypt. Not only was the Egyptian capital moved to a city
dedicated to Aton, but other cities were dedicated to him in
Nubia and in Asia. The <i>Hymn to the Aton</i> expresses the same
type of universalism, envisioning Aton (the sun) as the god who
blesses all people everywhere. While the Nile might have served
as a god to unite all Egyptians, the sun was a deity who might
unite all men in a common brotherhood. This, at any rate, seems
to have been Akhenaton&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>There remained, however, illogical elements in the monotheism
of Akhenaton. The Pharaoh himself was still a god, and
Akhenaton had no doubt that he was the divine son of Aton.
While Akhenaton and the royal family paid homage to Aton,
others stood in awe before the Pharaoh. There were elements in
the Amarna faith which militated against this, particularly the
realism which enabled the citizens of Akhetaton to caricature
their king, but the concept of a divine Pharaoh persisted in the
Aton cult.</p>
<p>No image represented Aton in human shape, as the &ldquo;thousand
gods&rdquo; of Egypt had been represented. Instead, worship was
directed toward the disk of the sun which exerts a life-giving
influence through its rays which produce a brilliance and warmth
that no man can fail to experience. The symbol of the god Aton
was a solar disk from which rays of light descended, terminating
in human hands, some of which hold the Egyptian sign of life
(<i>ankh</i>). In this symbolism, the sun graciously bestows life upon
the worshiper of Aton. Sometimes the royal uraeus, symbol of
kingship, hangs from the sun disk, and often it rises from the
bottom of the disk toward the center. Aton is thus depicted as
ruler as well as deity of all upon whom he shines.</p>
<p>While the Aton temple was not basically different from other
shrines of ancient Egypt, it boasted no image and conducted its
most solemn rites in the open, under the direct rays of the sun.
This formed a distinct contrast to the cult of Amon who was
called &ldquo;the hidden one,&rdquo; and who had his shrine in the innermost
and darkest part of the temple. If Amonism stressed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
mysterious in religion, Atonism spoke of the deity&rsquo;s nearness and
presence in the affairs of daily life. Atonism had no dark courts
or mysterious rites. Its ritual was quite simple, with hymns sung
by the temple choir and the presentation of gifts of meat and
drink by worshipers. The odors of perfume and the presence of
flowers added aesthetic qualities to the simple acts of worship.
On the occasion of royal visits, which must have been quite frequent,
the king personally consecrated the offerings.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/i11.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="573" />
<p class="caption">The Beneficent Aton. The sun disk is depicted with rays extended toward Akhenaton and his wife Nofretete. From the tomb of Ramose.</p>
</div>
<p>Atonism never became the popular faith of Egypt, but it did
spread beyond the confines of Akhetaton. Memphis had an Aton
temple, and Aton reliefs have been found at Heliopolis. Modern
students of religion sometimes charge that the Aton faith was
devoid of ethical content, but this is an argument from silence.
All of its literary remains consist of devotional literature&mdash;hymns
extolling the glories of Aton and tomb inscriptions which describe
the piety of his faithful worshipers. Whether or not Atonism
was self consciously pacifist in orientation may be debated.
A universal faith minimizes the differences among men, and
Akhenaton&rsquo;s failure to intervene in the affairs of his Asiatic
subjects may indicate that he hoped that a peaceful policy would
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
resolve international tensions. Perhaps we should conclude that
Akhenaton chose to devote himself to religious matters, and that
the chaos in Asia was a result of neglect rather than self-conscious
policy.</p>
<p>The Amarna tomb inscriptions give extravagant praise to Aton
and his son, the Pharaoh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How prosperous is he who hears thy doctrine of life and is sated
with beholding thee, and unceasingly his eyes look upon Aton
every day.</p>
<p>Thou art my great servant who hears my doctrine. My heart is
content with every commission thou performest and I give thee
the office in order that thou mayest eat the victuals of Pharaoh,
the lord in the house of Aton.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Moses and Aton</h3>
<p>Since Akhenaton&rsquo;s worship of Aton as &ldquo;sole god&rdquo; is earlier than
the date commonly ascribed to Moses (<i>ca.</i> 1280 B.C.), historians
have puzzled over possible relationships between the monotheism
of Akhenaton and the Biblical concept of one God. Sigmund
Freud in his <i>Moses and Monotheism</i> sought to trace the Hebrew-Christian
faith to the Amarna revolt of Akhenaton.</p>
<p>The principal reason for associating Moses with Atonism is
the fact of his birth and education in Egypt. The Scriptures assert,
however, that the religious impetus of Moses did not come
from Egyptian sources, which he completely disavowed (cf.
Exod. 18:10-11). It was in the wilderness that Moses had the
religious experiences which prepared him to become the leader
of the Exodus (Exod. 3:1-6). Jethro, Moses&rsquo; Midianite father-in-law,
worshiped Yahweh (Exod. 18:10-12) and Moses may have
learned much from him. Yahwism and the religion of Egypt
were completely and self-consciously opposed to one another.
Israel firmly believed that Yahweh, their God, had defeated
Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt in the experience of the Exodus.</p>
<h3>The Death of Aton</h3>
<p>Within a generation after the death of Akhenaton, Atonism
was dead, and its leading exponent was contemptuously called,
&ldquo;that criminal of Akhetaton.&rdquo; The religion never had a popular
base, and that disintegration of the empire might effectively be
charged to the displeasure of Amon at his neglect. The government
was moved back to Thebes, and Akhenaton&rsquo;s son-in-law,
Tutankhaton (&ldquo;the living image of Aton&rdquo;), became Tutankhamon
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
(&ldquo;the living image of Amon&rdquo;). The cycle was now complete.
Thebes and Amon had been restored to their former place
of supremacy, the monuments erected by Akhenaton were defaced
and the Aton temple was removed stone by stone. By the
time of Moses, Akhetaton was abandoned completely, and Atonism
had been forgotten.</p>

<br />THE HYMN TO THE ATON</h2>
<p>Our most important source for knowledge of the Aton cult is
found in the tombs of the nobles east of Akhetaton. These tombs
include reliefs bearing hymns in praise to Aton and to his son,
Akhenaton. Either the Pharaoh composed them himself, or they
were composed by courtiers who had completely assimilated the
religious convictions which were basic to his reforms. The so-called
long hymn to Aton not only extols the glories of the god
of Akhenaton, but it also contains expressions which have become
a part of Egyptian, and even Hebrew devotional literature.
The Long Hymn was inscribed on the walls of the tomb prepared
for the priest and courtier Eye who had known Akhenaton
from his youth.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> James H. Breasted suggested that it was an excerpt
from the ritual of the Aton temple.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>

Wife, Nefer-neferu-Aton, Nofertiti whom he loves, may she
live and flourish for ever and ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tb">Although the Hymn to the Aton clearly grants a favored position
to Egypt, Aton is pictured as holding sway over all peoples,
for the sun brings light and heat to men of every nation.
This universalism finds a modern counterpart in the hymn of
Joseph Addison (1712):</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The spacious firmament on high,</p>
<p class="t0">With all the blue ethereal sky,</p>
<p class="t0">And spangled heavens, a shining frame,</p>
<p class="t0">Their great Original proclaim:</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; unwearied sun, from day to day,</p>
<p class="t0">Does his creator&rsquo;s power display,</p>
<p class="t0">And publishes to every land</p>
<p class="t0">The work of an almighty hand.</p>
</div>
<p>Parallels between the Hymn to the Aton and Psalm 104 suggest
that the poetic expressions of the hymn became a part of the
literary heritage of the Near East. Although Atonism as a religion
died a short time after the death of its chief apostle,
Akhenaton, poetic utterances used in praise to Aton could
readily be incorporated into other Egyptian devotional literature
and, eventually, find an echo in the literature of other lands.
While many of the similarities between Psalm 104 and Akhenaton&rsquo;s
Hymn could arise from independent contemplation of the
movements of the sun on the part of people with no contact
whatever, the numerous contacts between Israel and Egypt at
least suggest that devotional language as well as proverbs (cf.
I Kings 4:30) were common knowledge among the two peoples.</p>
<p>The two compositions are basically different, however, in
that the Biblical psalmist acknowledges Yahweh, the God of
creation and providence, as a spiritual being associated with
natural phenomena only as their creator, whereas Aton, Akhenaton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sole god&rdquo; is identified with the disk of the sun. While
Akhenaton seems to have spiritualized the Egyptian sun worship,
he never divorced himself completely from it. Biblical
monotheism asserts that the One God made &ldquo;lights in the firmament
of heaven to give light upon the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:15). The
Hymn of the Aton reaches a high point in the devotional
literature of Egypt, but its monotheism was radically different
from that presented on the pages of Scripture.</p>

<br />THE AFFAIRS OF EMPIRE</h2>
<p>The Amarna tablets enable us to see evidences of the decline
of Egyptian power and prestige during the latter years of the
reign of Amenhotep III and throughout the reign of Amenhotep
IV (Akhenaton). About forty of them record correspondence
between the rulers of Egypt and the rulers of the major powers
of the Amarna Age. We find letters from the Kassite kings
Kadashman-Enlil I and Bumaburiash II of Babylon, from Ashuruballit
I of Assyria, from Tushratta of Mitanni, from the Hittite
king Suppiluliumas, and from an unnamed king of Alashia
(Cyprus).</p>
<h3>The Kings of Mitanni</h3>
<p>In upper Mesopotamia, Egypt had an ally in Mitanni, a kingdom
comprised largely of Hurrians (Biblical Horites), with an
Indo-Aryan ruling class. The Mitannian kingdom was established
about 1500 B.C. and at the height of its power reached from
Nuzi and Arrapkha in Assyria to Alalakh in Syria. Its capital,
Wassukkanni, was on the upper Habur River. A major threat
both to Mitanni and, ultimately, to Egypt, came from the rising
Hittite Empire with its capital at Hatusa (modern Bogazkoy) on
the great bend of the Halys River in Asia Minor. Babylon had
suffered an eclipse since the empire of Hammurabi and during
the Amarna age it was ruled by a mountain people known as
Kassites. Assyria, north of Babylon, had been subject to Mitanni
until the Hittite conquest of Mitanni gave the Assyrians an opportunity
to free themselves and develop an independent state.</p>
<p>The kings of Mitanni sent daughters to grace the harems of
the Pharaohs of Egypt, and desired gold in exchange. The
Amarna tablets include seven letters from Tushratta of Mitanni
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
to Amenhotep III, one to his widow Queen Tiy, and three to
Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton). In a typical communication he
writes to Amenhotep III:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let my brother send gold in very great quantity, without measure&mdash;that
is what my brother should send me&mdash;and let my brother
send more gold than (he sent) to my father, for in my brother&rsquo;s
land gold is as plentiful as dust. May the gods so direct that,
although now gold is so plentiful in my brother&rsquo;s land, he may
have gold ten times more plentiful than now. Let not the gold
which I desire trouble the heart of my brother, and let not my
brother grieve my heart. So let my brother send me gold, without
measure, in very great quantity.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Tushratta&rsquo;s lust for gold may not have been appreciated
in Thebes, Egypt valued her Mitannian allies who served as
a check on the ambitious Hittites, thereby helping Egypt maintain
control over Syria and Palestine. Not only were princesses
from Mitanni welcome in Egypt, but the Mitannian gods might
be of help to the Egyptians. During the illness of Amenhotep
III, Tushratta sent a statue of the goddess Ishtar from Nineveh
to bless the ailing Pharaoh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus saith Ishtar, mistress of all the lands, &ldquo;To Egypt, to the
land which I love I will go; I will return.&rdquo; Verily I have now sent
her, and she is gone. Indeed in the time of my father the
mistress (Ishtar) went to that land, and inasmuch as she was revered
when she formerly resided there, so now may my brother
tenfold more than formerly honor her. May my brother honor
her and joyfully send her back, and may she return. May Ishtar,
mistress of heaven, protect my brother and me one hundred thousand
years, and may our lady give to us both great joy.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tushratta looked to Egypt for help against Suppiluliumas
and the emerging Hittite Empire, but neither gold nor troops
came. Akhenaton was singing the praises of Aton in Akhetaton
when the Hittites succeeded in entering and sacking the Mitannian
capital (<i>ca.</i> 1370 B.C.) and Tushratta was slain by one
of his own sons. The former king&rsquo;s exiled brother and rival,
Artatama, seems to have seized control in the confusion that
followed. Tushratta&rsquo;s son Mattiwaza (who may have been his
father&rsquo;s murderer) fled to the Hittites, and Shutarna, son of
Artatama, sought the friendship of the Assyrians in his bid for
the throne.</p>
<h3>Emerging Assyria</h3>
<p>The Mitannian Empire was at an end. Mattiwaza gained
Hittite support and took the throne of Mitanni with the aid of
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Suppiluliumas&rsquo; army. He remained a vassal of the Hittites, however,
and his marriage to a daughter of Suppiluliumas further
strengthened Hittite power in Mitanni. At the same time Ashuruballit
of Assyria took advantage of the situation to seize the
portion of Mitanni nearest to him. Assyria had been controlled
alternately by Mitanni from the west and by Babylon from the
south, but Ashuruballit determined to head an independent
state.</p>
<p>To strengthen his position, Ashuruballit sent messengers to
Akhenaton with a present of two white horses and a silver
chariot. The letter accompanying these gifts<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> asks nothing in
return, but a second letter<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> mentions a new palace that Ashuruballit
is building, with the suggestion, &ldquo;If thou art very friendly
disposed, then send much gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the Assyrian embassy was received with courtesy in
the court of Akhenaton, for Burnaburiash of Babylon was unhappy
at the thought that Egypt would deal with a people who
had been subject to Babylon. In anger he dispatched a letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Niphururia (i.e., Akhenaton), king of Egypt, say. Thus says
Burnaburiash, king of Karduniash (i.e., Babylon), brother. I
am well. May it be well with you, your house, your wives, your
sons, your land, your chief men, your horses, your chariots. Since
my fathers and your fathers established friendly relations with
one another they sent rich presents to one another, and they
refused not any good request one of the other. Now my brother
has sent (only) two minas of gold as a present. But now, if
gold is plentiful send me as much as your fathers, but if it is
scarce send half of what your fathers did. Why did you send
(only) two minas of gold. Now, since my work on the House of
God is great, and I have undertaken its accomplishment vigorously,
send much gold. And you, whatsover you desire from my
land, write and it shall be brought to you. In the time of Kurigalzu,
my father, the Canaanites as one man wrote to him saying,
&ldquo;We will go against the border of the land (i.e., Egypt), and
we will stage an invasion, and we will make an alliance with
you.&rdquo; But my father wrote to them saying, &ldquo;Cease speaking of
an alliance with me. If you are hostile against the king of Egypt,
my brother, and ally yourself with another, I will come and will
plunder you for he is in alliance with me.&rdquo; My father did not
listen to them for the sake of your father. Now, concerning the
Assyrians, my subjects, have I not written to you? If you love
me you will not do business with them. Let them accomplish
nothing. As a present I have sent to you three minas of beautiful
lapis-lazuli, and five span of horses for five wooden chariots.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h3>The Hittite Challenge</h3>
<p>The Egyptians, however, did not give serious attention to their
Asian Empire until the reigns of Seti I (1318-1299 B.C.) and
Rameses II (1299-1232 B.C.). During the half century following
the fall of Mitanni the Hittites met no serious opposition in their
desire to control the whole of northern Mesopotamia and the
Mediterranean coastal region of Syria. Not only was a daughter
of Suppiluliumas married to the ruler of the vassal kingdom of
Mitanni, but a son, Telepinus, was installed as ruler of Aleppo
in Syria. The Amorites who had been vassals to Egypt were
glad to welcome Hittite aid in establishing their independence.
North Syria, or Amurru, became a hotbed of anti-Egyptian feeling,
and Amorite princes served as unconscious pawns of Suppiluliumas
in weakening Egyptian control in the area and preparing
the way for Hittite domination.</p>
<p>Most of the Amarna letters were written by princes of city
states in Syria, Phoenicia, and Canaan who acknowledged
sovereignty but expressed the fear that rival princes or alien
peoples might gain the upper hand. Some of the letters represent
factional disputes among leaders both of whom protest
their loyalty to Egypt. Among the rulers in Syria and Palestine
we find letters from Akizzi of Qatna, Abdi-Ashirta and his son
Aziru of Amurru (i.e., the Amorites), Rib-Addi of Byblos, Ammunira
of Beirut, Zimrida of Sidon, Abimilki of Tyre, and Abdi-Khepa
of Jerusalem. Other letters were sent from Hazor, Akko,
Megiddo, Gezer, Ashelon, and Lachish. In some instances
minor Egyptian officials wrote the letters.</p>
<h3>Rib-Addi of Byblos</h3>
<p>Rib-Addi of Byblos was threatened by Abdi-Ashirta and his
son Aziru, Amorite rulers who followed the Hittite &ldquo;party line&rdquo;
in seeking to remove northern Syria from the Egyptian sphere
of influence. Gebal, or Gubla, was the ancient name of Byblos,
a city which carried on commerce with Egypt as early as 3000
B.C. Excavations have produced a cylinder from the Thinite
period of Egyptian history when the earliest Pharaohs occupied
the throne. Vases discovered at Byblos bear the names of ancient
Pharaohs including Mycerinus (twenty-seventh century B.C.),
Unis and Pepi (twenty-fourth century B.C.). From the port of
Byblos, Egypt imported cedars and spruce for use in building
ships. Ships of Byblos also carried jars of oil, spices, wine, and
leather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Although Rib-Addi wished to continue to serve as a loyal
vassal of Egypt, the chaos of the political situation pressed
heavily upon him. The Amarna collection includes fifty-three
letters which he addressed to Amenhotep II and Akhenaton
warning them of the difficulty of the situation. In one of them
he notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abdi-Ashirta has written to the warriors, &ldquo;Assemble yourselves
in the house of Ninib, and we will fall upon Byblos.&rdquo;... Thus
have they formed a conspiracy with one another, and thus have
I great fear that there is no man to rescue me out of their hand.
Like birds that lie in a net, so am I in Byblos. Why do you hold
yourself back in respect to your land? Behold, thus I have written
to the palace, and you have paid no attention to my word....
What shall I do in my solitude? Behold, thus I ask day and
night.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru also wrote letters to Egypt
affirming their loyalty. Two of them were addressed by Aziru to
Dudu, an officer of the Egyptian court with a Semitic name.
Evidently Dudu occupied a place in the court of Akhenaton
comparable to that which Joseph occupied some years before
(Gen. 41:37-57). Aziru wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Dudu, my lord, my father.</p>
<p>So says Aziru, your son your servant:</p>
<p>At the feet of my father I will fall down. May my father be well.
Dudu, behold I have performed the wish of the king, my lord,
and whatever may be the wish of the king, my lord, let him write
and I will perform it. Further: Behold, you are there, my father,
and whatever is the wish of Dudu, my father, write, and I will
indeed perform it. Behold you are my father and my lord, and I
am your son. The lands of Amurru are your lands, and my house
is your house, and all your wish, write, and indeed I will perform
your wish. And indeed you are sitting before the king, my
lord. Enemies have spoken slanderous words to my father before
the king, my lord. But do not admit them. May you sit before
the king, my lord, when I arise, and do not admit against me
slanderous words. I am a servant of the king, my lord, and I will
never depart from the words of the king, my lord, and from the
words of Dudu my father. But if the king, my lord, does not love
me but hates me, what shall I then say?<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt that Rib-Addi, and not Aziru, was
truly loyal to Egypt, for Aziru had made an alliance with Egypt&rsquo;s
enemies, the Hittites. Writing to the Egyptian Pharaoh, Rib-Addi
complained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have written to the king, my lord: &ldquo;They have taken all my
cities. The son of Abdi-Ashirta is their lord. Byblos is the only
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
city that belongs to me.&rdquo; And have I not sent my messenger to
the king, my lord? But you did not send soldiers, and you did not
permit my messenger to leave.... Send him with auxiliaries.
If the king hates his city, then I will abandon it, and if he permits
me, an old man, to depart, then send your man that he
may protect it. Why was nothing given to me from the palace?
I have heard of the Hati people (i.e. the Hittites) that they burn
the lands with fire. I have repeatedly written but no answer has
come to me. All lands of the king, my lord, are conquered, and
my lord holds himself back from them, and behold, now they
bring soldiers from the Hati lands to conquer Byblos. Therefore
care for thy city.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rib-Addi stood alone in defending Byblos, but the force
of the enemy proved too much. He fled to Beirut where he
found refuge in the palace of its prince, Ammunira, with whom
he was related by marriage. Byblos fell, but Rib-Addi still
hoped for aid from Egypt to win it back. From Beirut he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the king holds back in respect to the city, all the cities of
Canaan (Kinahni) will be lost to him.... But let the king, my
lord, quickly send archers that they may take the city at once.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally Egypt did act. Aziru was apprehended and taken to
Egypt where he was evidently detained for some time. A son
of Aziru addressed a letter to the Egyptian official Dudu begging
him for his father&rsquo;s release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aziru is your servant. Do not detain him there. Send him back
quickly that he may protect the lands of the king, our Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to mention &ldquo;the Sudu people&rdquo; who were taking
advantage of Aziru&rsquo;s absence to further their own ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And all lands and all Sudu-people have said, &ldquo;Aziru does not
come from Egypt.&rdquo; And now the Sudu steal out of the lands
and exalt themselves against me, saying, &ldquo;Your father dwells in
Egypt, so we will make hostility with you.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not know what happened to Rib-Addi. By his own
testimony he was an old man, but whether he died of natural
causes or was a casualty in the battles of his generation we do
not know. There seems to be a poetic justice in the fate of Aziru.
As he had terrorized the Phoenician countryside, so his Amorite
lands were terrorized by other tribes which were seeking a place
for themselves in a time of general chaos. While Suppiluliumas
backed Aziru, the Hittites were really only using him as a pawn
to weaken Egyptian control in Asia and prepare the way for
Hittite domination.</p>

<h3>Lab&lsquo;ayu of Shechem</h3>
<p>The troublemaker in the region around Shechem was a man
named Lab&lsquo;ayu who, in league with the &lsquo;Apiru people, sought
to control the central hill country of Canaan. Like Aziru, farther
north, Lab&lsquo;ayu sent letters to Egypt affirming his loyalty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, I am a faithful servant of the king, and I have not
committed a crime, and I have not sinned, and I do not refuse
my tribute, and I do not refuse the demand of my deputy. Behold,
I have been slandered and evil entreated but the king,
my lord, has not made known to me my crime.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biridya of Megiddo, however, saw things differently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the king, my lord and my sun, say: Thus says Biridya, the
faithful servant of the king. At the feet of the king, my lord and
my sun, seven and seven times I fall. Let the king know that
ever since the archers returned, Lab&lsquo;ayu has carried on hostilities
against me, and we are not able to pluck the wool, and we are
not able to go outside the gate in the presence of Lab&lsquo;ayu since
he has learned that you have not given archers, and now his
face is set to take Megiddo, but let the king protect his city
lest Lab&lsquo;ayu seize it. Indeed, the city is destroyed by death from
pestilence and disease. Let the king give one hundred garrison
troops lest Lab&lsquo;ayu seize it. Verily there is no other purpose in
Lab&lsquo;ayu. He seeks to destroy Megiddo.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biridya succeeded in capturing Lab&lsquo;ayu, and plans were made
to send him to Egypt. He was turned over to Zurata of Akko, an
ally of Biridya, who was to send him to Egypt by ship. Zurata,
however, accepted a bribe and released Lab&lsquo;ayu.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> His freedom
was brief for Lab&lsquo;ayu was murdered before he could reach
home, but lawlessness continued as the sons of Lab&lsquo;ayu continued
to terrorize the countryside.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<h3>Abdi-Khepa of Jerusalem</h3>
<p>At least seven letters were addressed to the Pharaoh by Abdi-Khepa
of Jerusalem, asking help in resisting the encroachments
of a people known as &lsquo;Apiru. He notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As sure as there is a ship in the midst of the sea, the mighty arm
of the king conquers. Nahrim and Kapasi, but now the &lsquo;Apiru
are taking the cities of the king. There is not a single governor
remaining to the king, my lord. All have perished.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abdi-Khepa tends to classify all his enemies as &lsquo;Apiru, a word
which in such contexts is practically synonymous with outlaw,
or bandit. Things are so bad, Abdi-Khepa states, that the tribute
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
which he sent to Egypt was captured by these marauders on the
plain of Ajalon.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> This may have happened, but reports concerning
Abdi-Khepa himself suggest that it would not have been
beneath his dignity to concoct such a story to avoid paying
tribute.</p>
<p>A neighboring king, Suwardata, thought to have been ruler
of Hebron, complained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the king, my lord, should know that Abdi-Khepa has taken
my city out of my hand. Further, let the king, my lord, ask if I
have taken a man, or even an ox or an ass from him.... Further,
Lab&lsquo;ayu who had taken our cities is dead, but verily Abdi-Khepa
is another Lab&lsquo;ayu and he takes our cities.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On other occasions, however, Suwardata and Abdi-Khepa
were allied against a common foe, the &lsquo;Apiru. Suwardata wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king, my lord, should know that the &lsquo;Apiru have arisen in
the land which the god of the king, my lord, has given me, and
they have attacked it, and the king my lord, should know that
all my brothers have abandoned me. I and Abdi-Khepa alone are
left to fight against the &lsquo;Apiru, and Zurata, the prince of Akko,
and Indurata the prince of Achsaph, were the ones who hastened
to my help.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Amarna Age Palestine</h3>
<p>The petty kings in Canaan were permitted their own armed
forces comprising chariots, owned by the aristocracy, and footmen
drawn from the peasant classes. Egypt did not interfere in
local rivalries as long as her revenues continued to come and her
commissioners were able to carry on the royal projects. When a
local ruler had a grievance against his fellows, he could plead
his case showing that the interests of Egypt would be best served
by enabling him to defeat his rivals. This usually meant a request
for troops&mdash;particularly bowmen. Egypt tolerated the perpetual
squabbles of her subject states, and it may even have been a
policy to allow such quarrels rather than to permit one state to
gain enough power that it could forge an empire of its own.</p>
<p>Many of the strongholds held by the rulers of Canaanite city
states had been fortified in Hyksos times. Egyptian control,
however, was maintained through commissioners appointed by
the Pharaoh to collect taxes and supervise the compulsory labor
groups which worked on roads, tended the Lebanon forest preserves,
or worked in the Valley of Esdraelon where wheat was
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
grown for the royal court. Under strong Pharaohs, the interests of
the Empire were carefully guarded, but the Amarna Age was
a period during which Egyptian prestige was in eclipse and
local rivalries became increasingly bitter. Only in extreme
instances did Egypt interfere, and then it was usually too late to
rectify matters.</p>
<p>A brief letter from Biridya of Megiddo indicates that forced
labor (corv&eacute;e) was expected of the subject states. Many, however,
sensing the loss in Egyptian power failed to provide
laborers for the royal projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the king, my lord and my sun, say: Thus Biridya, the true
servant of the king, my lord and my sun, seven times and seven
times I fall. Let the king be informed concerning his servant and
concerning his city. Behold I am working in the town of Shunama,
and I bring men of the corv&eacute;e, but behold the governors who
are with me do not as I do; they do not work in the town of
Shunama; and they do not bring men for the corv&eacute;e, but I alone
bring men for the corv&eacute;e from the town of Yapu. They come from
Shunama and likewise from the town of Nuribda. So let the king
be informed concerning his city.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The &lsquo;Apiru</h3>
<p>The identity of the &lsquo;Apiru (also written in cuneiform SA GAZ)
has puzzled scholars since the discovery of the Amarna tablets.
Some categorically affirmed that the &lsquo;Apiru are identical with
the Biblical Hebrews, or Israelites, and that the Amarna tablets
reflect the Canaanite version of events described in the Biblical
book of Joshua.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> Most scholars now agree that the &lsquo;Apiru cannot
be identified with the Biblical Hebrews, although many suggest
that the peoples are related. A strong argument against identification
comes from the fact that &lsquo;Apiru appear in a wide variety
of places of which there is no hint in the Biblical narrative. They
appear in Sumer during the Ur III dynasty (<i>ca.</i> 2050 B.C.), in
Larsa during the reigns of Warad-Sin and Rim-Sin (<i>ca.</i> 1770-1698 B.C.),
in Hammurabi&rsquo;s Babylon (<i>ca.</i> 1728-1686 B.C.), in
Mari during the reign of Zimri Lim (<i>ca.</i> 1730-1700 B.C.). They
are mentioned in the large bodies of texts from Nuzi, Ugarit, and
Bogazkoy. None of these references bear any relationship to the
people of Israel.</p>
<p>In the Mari tablets the &lsquo;Apiru are described as a semi-nomadic
people settled in the area between the Habur and the Balikh
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
rivers, north of the Euphrates. The tablets from Alalakh mention
that King Idrimi lived seven years among &lsquo;Apiru soldiers.
Studies in the personal names of individuals designated &lsquo;Apiru
in the Amarna and the Nuzi tablets have shown that they do not
belong to any one ethnic group, although West Semitic names
are most common in the Amarna texts.</p>
<p>There is considerable evidence that the &lsquo;Apiru were regarded
as a social rather than an ethnic group. At Bogazkoy they are
listed among the social classes and appear to have been classified
between freemen and slaves. Wherever they appear they
have one common trait&mdash;they are beyond the jurisdiction of the
established authority. They frequently appear as a landless people
who enter into dependent status as agricultural workers or
soldiers in exchange for maintenance. The &lsquo;Apiru of the Amarna
tablets are never described as invaders. They are people within
the land who occupy areas not controlled by the larger towns.
In a time of weak central government they sought to profit from
the general confusion by challenging the city-states. Whatever
their ethnic origins, they were doubtless joined by a variety of
peoples from the oppressed elements of the population. To the
rulers of Canaan, the &lsquo;Apiru were lawless bandits, a menace
to society. Although &lsquo;Apiru is a much more inclusive term than
Israel, the citizens of the city-states of Canaan probably thought
of Joshua&rsquo;s army much as they regarded the &lsquo;Apiru of the Amarna
Age.</p>
<p>Although the place names of the Amarna texts are parallel to
those of the Old Testament, the personal names are totally different.
In Joshua we read of Adoni-zedek, not Abdi-Khepa, as
king of Jerusalem, and a number of other kings are named for
the period of the conquest (cf. Josh. 10:3). Meredith G. Kline,
who holds to the early date of the Exodus (1440 B.C.) has suggested
that the conquest of Canaan by Joshua precedes the
Amarna Age and that the &lsquo;Apiru of the Amarna letters may
actually be the forces of Cushan Rishathaim, Israel&rsquo;s first oppressor
during the time of the Judges. He concludes that the
&lsquo;Apiru are not to be associated with Israel, but rather must be
regarded as oppressors&mdash;the first of a series of such oppressors
described in the Book of Judges.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Most contemporary scholars date the conquest of Canaan after
the Amarna Age, suggesting some time around 1280 B.C., as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
probable date of the Exodus.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> This would place the Amarna
Age in the period between Joseph and Moses. Aside from the
fact that Israel was in Egypt during this time, and that they lost
the favored position which they enjoyed in the days of Joseph,
Scripture passes over this period with complete silence.</p>
<p>While we may not be able to pinpoint the exact chronology,
the description of events in Canaan during the Amarna Age
lends perspective to Biblical history during the years before the
Monarchy. Local and tribal loyalties were more meaningful than
imperial government, and centralized government was looked
upon with suspicion (cf. Judg. 9:7-15).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII
<br />TRADE AND COMMERCE DURING THE AMARNA AGE</h2>
<p>By the Amarna Age the Mediterranean had become a highway
for the ships of Egypt, Crete, Cyprus, Ugarit, the Phoenician
cities, and even distant Mycenae. Land routes around the Fertile
Crescent saw a steady stream of caravans bearing tribute to kings
and items of trade for commoners. Horses and lapis lazuli were
carried westward from Babylon, and its king Burnaburiash hoped
for large quantities of Egyptian gold. Caravans were subject to
attack, and Burnaburiash made it clear that it was the duty of
Akhenaton to punish such offenders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canaan (Kinahhi) is your land, and its kings are your servants.
In your land I have been violently dealt with. Blind them (i.e.,
the raiders) and make good the money which they have stolen. Kill
the people who murdered my servants and avenge their blood,
for if you do not kill these people they will return, and my
caravans, or even your messengers they will murder, and messengers
between us will be intercepted, and if that happens, the
inhabitants of the land will fall away from you.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The king of Alashia (Cyprus) sent copper to Egypt, requesting
silver and gold in exchange.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> Iron, which in Hyksos times
had twice the value of gold, became more plentiful during the
Amarna Age. Tushratta of Mitanni sent iron to Egypt.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> Iron,
however, was not in common use in Israel until the time of
David (I Chron. 22:3; 29:2). During the days of Saul, the
Philistines had a monopoly on iron in Canaan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of
Israel, for the Philistines said, &ldquo;Lest the Hebrews make themselves
swords or spears&rdquo;; but every one of the Israelites went
down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
his axe or his sickle, and the charge was a pim for the plowshares
and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening
the axes and setting the goads (I Sam. 13:19-21).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Minoan Crete</h3>
<p>The great sea power of the eastern Mediterranean prior to
the Amarna Age was Minoan Crete. The Cretans traded with
Egypt from the earliest history of the two peoples. In addition
to the direct route across the Mediterranean, the Minoans made
use of an indirect trade route along the southwestern and
southern shores of Asia Minor, and then southward by way of
Cyprus to Egypt. The Egyptian word <i>Keftiu</i> (Hebrew <i>Caphtorim</i>,
Gen. 10:14; Deut. 2:23; Amos 9:7) may be used of the
peoples of southern Asia Minor as well as the inhabitants of
Crete and its adjacent islands. The Philistines trace their ancestry
to the <i>Caphtorim</i> (Amos 9:7), accounting for a non-Semitic
element in southern Canaan.</p>
<p>Cretan trade with Egypt is depicted in the tomb of Rekhmire,
lieutenant governor of Upper Egypt under Thothmes III (<i>ca.</i>
1490-1435 B.C.).<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> Here a prince of the <i>Keftiu</i> is depicted with
gifts for the rulers of Egypt. Cretan power came to an abrupt
end, however, some time around the end of the fifteenth century
B.C., when Knossus, the capital, and other centers of Minoan
culture were destroyed. The cause is not known, but Mycenaeans
from mainland Greece may have been responsible, at least in
part, for the fall of Knossus.</p>
<p>Early in the fourteenth century B.C., Mycenae became the
cultural and political center of the Aegean world. Trade with
Egypt brought to the Mycenaeans the ivory that appears frequently
in their tombs. Scarabs discovered at Mycenae bear the
names of Amenhotep III and his wife, Tiy.</p>
<h3>The Phoenicians</h3>
<p>It was not the Mycenaeans, however, but the Phoenicians who
succeeded the Minoans as the seafarers and the traders of the
eastern Mediterranean. A tomb painting from Thebes shows
Phoenician merchant ships tied up at docks along the Nile with
their crews selling merchandise in the Egyptian bazaar. Amarna
letters speak of Tyrian sailors and the wealth of their home port.
Ships of Arvad also carry merchandise to Egypt. Phoenician
control of the eastern Mediterranean was not challenged until
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
Rome fought a series of wars with Carthage, which began as
a Phoenician colony. We know the conflicts as the Punic (i.e.,
Phoenician) wars.</p>
<p>Commerce was not without its dangers. Roving bands of
pirates from Lycia in Asia Minor infested the eastern Mediterranean
and even landed on the coast of the Egyptian Delta.
Amenhotep III found it necessary to organize a police force to
patrol the Delta coast and keep the mouths of the Delta closed
to all but lawful ships. The police manned customs houses and
collected duty on all merchandise that was not consigned to
the king. The land routes into Egypt were also policed, and admission
was only granted to those with legitimate business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII
<br />THE ART OF AMARNA</h2>
<p>Akhenaton&rsquo;s influence in art, like his religious beliefs, had
antecedents and it would be improper to give him the credit&mdash;or
blame&mdash;for all the art forms which found expression during
the period of his reign. Nevertheless, under his inspiration we
meet a new type of naturalism, almost an expressionism, coming
to full flower. W. Stevenson Smith notes, &ldquo;Men of ability ...
fell in with the ideas of Amenhotep IV and after a few tentative
efforts, developed a new style with remarkable speed.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> Bas
reliefs show that Akhenaton was personally interested in art. He
appears on visits to the sculptors&rsquo; workshops in the company of
Nofretete. Akhenaton&rsquo;s views of art are reflected in the royal
monuments of his reign, the stelae that were erected to mark
the boundaries of Akhetaton, and in the tombs prepared for
government officials in the eastern desert.</p>
<h3>Sunken Relief</h3>
<p>One change in the Amarna Age art was purely mechanical.
Sunken relief replaces the traditional raised relief in the ornamentation
of the rock tombs. Davies comments on the technique:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rock in which they are hewn is far from having the uniform
good quality which would invite bas-reliefs of the usual kind.
Nor was Akhenaton willing, it appears, to employ the flat painting
on plastered walls which was so much in vogue, and which
the artists of Akhetaton also employed at times with good effect.
The idea of modelling in plaster was conceived or adopted; and
since figures in plaster-relief would have been liable to easy
injury, the outline was sunk so far below the general surface as
to bring the parts in highest relief just to its level Nor was this
the only measure taken to ensure durability. The whole design
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
was first cut roughly in sunk-relief in the stone itself. Then a fine
plaster was spread over it, covering all the inequalities and yet
having the support of all points of a solid stone core. While the
plaster was still soft, it was moulded with a blunt tool into the
form and features which the artist desired. Finally the whole
was painted, all the outlines being additionally marked out in
red, frequently with such deviations as to leave the copyist in
dilemma between the painted and the moulded lines.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Queen Nofretete. The painted limestone bust shows the queen wearing a conical blue headdress encircled by a band to which the uraeus, symbol of royalty, is attached. The bust was found in the studio of the sculptor Thutmose at Akhetaton.</p>
</div>
<h3>Realism</h3>
<p>Akhenaton&rsquo;s chief contribution to art, however, was anything
but mechanical. Under his prodding, the artists at Akhetaton
developed a realism&mdash;and even a distortion&mdash;which contrasts
with the conservative, stylizing tendencies of earlier Egyptian
art. The chief sculptor Bek describes himself on a stele as one
&ldquo;whom his majesty himself taught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Weigall suggests that the innovations which Akhenaton
brought into the art of his day were, in fact, a self-conscious
return to earlier art forms. Young Akhenaton, Weigall assumes,
would have discovered that the sun god Re-Harakhti was much
more ancient than Amon of Thebes, and that ancient art forms
differed from those in use during the Theban supremacy. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
reverting to the religious views of the Heliopolitan priesthood,
Akhenaton would also have chosen to effect a renaissance of
earlier art forms.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Others have speculated on the possibility of Minoan influence
on Akhenaton&rsquo;s art, noting that the Minoans adopted a naturalism
which parallels that of Amarna, although Knossus was
sacked some time during the reign of Amenhotep III. Barring the
migration of Minoan artists to Akhetaton (which is rather unlikely),
it may be best to see in the Amarna art forms a development
based upon changes which were already being felt in art
circles in Egypt. John A. Wilson notes that the older stylized
art forms were on their way out as early as the reign of Thutmose
III, and that the earlier tradition ended by the time of
Hatshepsut.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>The naturalism of Akhenaton, however, goes far beyond his
predecessors. The Pharaoh is not depicted in the splendid isolation
of a god-king, but in the informal pose of a husband and
father. Akhenaton habitually appears in the company of his
wife, Nofretete, and their daughters, of whom ultimately there
were six. A stele depicts Akhenaton kissing an infant while a
second child sits on the queen&rsquo;s knee. Another shows a banquet
scene with the king gnawing on a large piece of meat while his
wife is eating roast fowl with her hands.</p>
<h3>Caricature</h3>
<p>Not only informality, but actual caricature tended to mark the
art of Akhetaton. The natural deformities of the king were more
than faithfully reproduced&mdash;they were exaggerated. The elongated
skull, long thin neck, pointed chin, obtruding stomach, and
abnormally large hips and thighs of the king may have been
emphasized by artists who felt that any characteristic of a son
of Aton deserves special attention.</p>
<p>The way in which people reacted to the king&rsquo;s wishes may be
seen in a child&rsquo;s toy depicted at Akhetaton. A tomb painting
&ldquo;shows a model chariot drawn by monkeys. In the chariot is
another monkey urging along his steeds (his receding forehead
is terribly like the king&rsquo;s), by him a monkey princess prods the
rump of the horse-monkeys which are jibbing and refusing to
budge an inch in spite of a monkey groom who is dragging at
their bridles for dear life.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> Such caricature would indicate that
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
the &ldquo;image&rdquo; of Pharaoh as a son of Aton has been popularly
dispelled, and with it much of his power over his subjects.</p>
<h3>Transitional Art Forms</h3>
<p>The transition from the pre-Amarna art forms to those
encouraged by Akhenaton may be observed in the tomb of the
vizier Ramose in the Theban necropolis. Ramose first had a portrait
of young Akhenaton carved in his tomb in the conventional
style, but later he added a second portrait in the new style. The
latter depicts Akhenaton standing with Nofretete beneath the
rays of the sun, bestowing golden necklets upon their faithful
vizier. Officials of the royal harem and a number of servants
look on. Akhenaton and his courtiers have the physical characteristics
which became conventional in Amarna art.</p>
<h3>The Development of Amarna Art</h3>
<p>The most violent break with the older convention came in the
early years of Akhenaton&rsquo;s reign. Before the move to Akhetaton,
the Theban hillside was dotted with tombs decorated with the
newer art forms and bearing inscriptions praising the Pharaoh.
With the move to Amarna, the art conventions matured. Artists
developed their own distinctive tastes and at times modified the
prevailing tendencies.</p>
<p>The painted stucco pavement which Petrie discovered in 1891
expresses the love of nature which the Aton cult encouraged. It
depicts a pool surrounded by clumps of flowers in which birds
are sporting and calves playing. Frescoes from the Green Room
of the North Palace, excavated by Francis Newton in 1924, represent
the luxuriance of a papyrus thicket full of beautiful birds,
brightened up here and there by blue lotuses.</p>
<p>Some of the finest specimens of ancient Egyptian art have
come from the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose, discovered
by Ludwig Borchard during the German expedition at Amarna
prior to World War I. In preparing a series of heads of members
of the royal family, Thutmose chose to refine rather than to stress
their physical peculiarities. Thutmose based his work on keen
observation, augmented by casts taken from life when he wanted
to record the characteristic features of his subject. Among his
masterpieces are the famous painted limestone bust of Nofretete&mdash;perhaps
the best known piece of Egyptian art; and an unfinished
portrait of the queen now in the Cairo Museum.</p>

<h2 id="c9">IX
<br />THE END OF AN ERA</h2>
<p>The high hopes of Akhenaton&rsquo;s early years met an untimely
end. The Asiatic provinces of Egypt fell away to the Hittites or
to local Canaanite princes who had little sympathy with the
Empire. Although there is no evidence of revolt in Egypt itself,
Akhenaton&rsquo;s alienation from the older priesthood must have
resulted in dislocations of the economy, and difficulties in the
smooth running of government.</p>
<h3>Smenkhkare</h3>
<p>There is some evidence to suggest that Nofretete lost favor
with her husband and moved to a new palace in the northern
sector of Akhetaton. The king gave high honor to his eldest
daughter Meritaton, whose husband, Smenkhkare became his
successor on the throne of Egypt. We have no records indicating
events in the earliest years of Smenkhkare&rsquo;s reign but in the
third year he is known to have gone to Thebes. The reason for
the visit can only be conjectured, but it may have been a gesture
to appease the Amon priesthood which was still firmly entrenched
there.</p>
<p>Our sources fail us again, but neither Akhenaton nor Smenkhkare
are mentioned after <i>ca.</i> 1350 B.C. Whether they died natural
deaths, or perished at the hands of assassins, can only be guessed.
We are not even sure if Smenkhkare was co-regent with his
father-in-law or if Akhenaton had died before he came to the
throne. At most Smenkhkare reigned but four years. If his trip
to Thebes was made to bring about a reconciliation with the
Theban priesthood, it seems to have failed completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3>Tutankhaton-Tutankhamon</h3>
<p>Smenkhkare&rsquo;s successor, Tutankhaton, was married to Ankhesenpaton,
the third daughter of Akhenaton and Nofretete. Under
Tutankhaton the capital was moved back to Thebes, and the
Amarna revolt was at an end. His name, meaning &ldquo;the living
image of Aton,&rdquo; was changed to Tutankhamon, &ldquo;the living
image of Amon,&rdquo; and Amon was restored to his place as chief
deity of Egypt. Ankhesenpaton&rsquo;s name was changed to Ankhesenpamon
for the same reason. Although Tuntankhamon was one
of Egypt&rsquo;s lesser kings, the discovery of his tomb by Howard
Carter in 1923 has made him the best known Pharaoh of Egyptian
history to most westerners.</p>
<p>Tutankhamon&rsquo;s return to the worship of Amon was a conscious
repudiation of the Aton cult. He actually ascribes the calamities
that befell Egypt in the years of Akhenaton to the anger of
Amon:</p>

<p class="caption">Tutankhamon and His God. A black granite statue depicts the god Amon (large figure) with Pharaoh Tutankhamon, who renounced the Aton faith of Akhenaton and returned to Thebes, the center of the Amon priesthood.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The temples of the gods and goddesses ... had gone to pieces.
Their shrines had become desolate and had become overgrown
mounds.... The land was topsy turvy and the gods turned
their backs upon this land. If one prayed to a god to seek counsel
from him, he would never come (at all). If one made supplication
to a goddess, similarly she would never come at all. Their hearts
were hurt (?) so they destroyed that which had been made.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following Tutankhamon&rsquo;s early death we meet a story of
intrigue and international politics which involves his widow.
Ankhesenpamon, fearful of the future of herself and her country,
wrote to the Hittite king, Suppiluliumas, asking that one of his
sons be sent to Egypt to become her husband:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My husband died, and I have no son. People say that you have
many sons. If you were to send me one of your sons, he might
become my husband. I am loath to take a servant of mine and
make him my husband.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hittite king, suspecting something amiss, sent a servant
to check on matters in Egypt. When the envoy reached Thebes,
the widowed queen asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you say, &ldquo;They may try to deceive me.&rdquo; If I had a son
would I write to a foreign country in a manner which is humiliating
to myself and my country. You do not trust me and tell me
such a thing. He who was my husband died and I have no sons.
Shall I perhaps take one of my servants and make him my husband?
I have not written to any other country. I have written
only to you. People say that you have many sons. Give me one
of your sons, and he is my husband and king in the land of
Egypt.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppiluliumas was convinced of the good faith of the young
widow and sent a son to Egypt, but the young man never
reached Thebes. Along the way he was murdered by Egyptians
who resented the thought of a foreigner as their ruler. The result
was a period of war between the Hittites and Egypt. Another
son of Suppiluliumas made a record of the affair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When my father gave them (the Egyptians) one of his sons (to
take over the kingship), they killed him as they led him there.
My father let his anger run away with him; he went to war
against Egypt and attacked Egypt.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The battle is not mentioned in the Egyptian annals. Probably
it was brief and indecisive, for the Hittites could not afford to
throw a major army into such a campaign. The rising power of
Assyria was a threat to Hittite control in the north, and she had
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
to be ready to protect her northern provinces. Had the Hittites
launched a major campaign against Egypt it is doubtful if she
could have survived.</p>

<p class="caption">Horemhab. Granite statue of the commander of Tutankhaton&rsquo;s armies, later a Pharaoh in his own right.</p>
</div>
<h3>Eye and Horemhab</h3>
<p>The rule of Egypt fell to the aged vizier Eye, who had been
a counselor and friend of Akhenaton. After four years Eye was
succeeded by Horemhab (<i>ca.</i> 1340-1310 B.C.), an energetic
ruler who sought to restore Egypt&rsquo;s fortunes abroad and erase
the memory of the Amarna revolt at home. As a young general,
Horemhab had espoused the cause of Akhenaton, but as a
Pharaoh he sought to obliterate the records of the Amarna kings
with as great enthusiasm as Akhenaton had sought to eliminate
the name of Amon. Later orthodox king lists omit the names of
Akhenaton, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamon, and Eye, placing the
name of Horemhab immediately after Amenhotep III.</p>
<p>Although the Amon priests of Thebes seemed to be more
firmly entrenched than ever after the accession of Horemhab,
the calendar could not be pushed back completely. Egyptian
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
art and literature retained some of the naturalism of the Amarna
movement. There were effects in the religious world, too, for
although Atonism was not pure monotheism, it exhibited tendencies
in that direction which persisted in the Egyptian thought.
God is frequently addressed in the singular, although under
different names, in the hymns of the later periods of Egyptian
history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c10">X
<br />AMARNA AND THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Amarna texts make it clear that the inhabitants of Canaan
during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries B.C. had a high
degree of culture. While most people were probably illiterate,
each community had its professional scribes who could write in
at least one foreign language. Akkadian cuneiform, and not
Canaanite, was the language of diplomatic correspondence between
the city states of Canaan and the Egyptian court.</p>
<h3>Written Records</h3>
<p>The Hebrew Scriptures give evidence that Israel made use of
written records before the composition of the canonical Bible.
References to the <i>Book of the Wars of the Lord</i>, and the <i>Book
of Jasher</i>, appear in the Pentateuch and Joshua (Num. 21:14;
Josh. 10:13). While the events which they commemorate may
have first been passed on by word of mouth, the word &ldquo;book&rdquo;
(<i>sepher</i>, inscription, written document) implies that they also
were recorded in written documents. By the time of the Judges,
a lad whom Gideon happened to meet along the road was able
to write the names of twenty-seven men who were the elders of
Succoth (Judg. 8:14).</p>
<p>The discovery of the Amarna Tablets created considerable
interest in the matter of writing in ancient Canaan, and among
the Israelites. Early in the twentieth century, Edouard Naville
of the University of Geneva argued that the earliest documents
of the Old Testament were written &ldquo;in the idiom and with the
characters of the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, namely Babylonian
cuneiform,&rdquo; or Akkadian as we call it today.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Naville went so far as to suggest that the Akkadian documents
which lie behind our Hebrew Old Testament (or at least the
Pentateuch and Joshua) were in use until the time of Ezra who
adapted them to the alphabet used by the Aramaic speaking
Jews of the Persian Empire. This view is not seriously considered
today, for we know that Early or Palaeo-Hebrew manuscripts
antedate the Square or Aramaic form of the letters in
current use. The Canaanite dialect in use at Ras Shamra, ancient
Ugarit, was written in a cuneiform alphabet at a time contemporary
with the Amarna texts. Another group of texts, dated
about 1500 B.C., was discovered at the Egyptian turquoise mines
in the Sinai Peninsula. There are about twenty-five inscriptions
in all, written in a form of alphabetic writing which was clearly
derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. Three short examples of
the same alphabet, dating somewhat earlier than the Sinai
inscriptions, have been discovered at Gezer, Lachish, and
Shechem in southern Canaan. The oldest actual Hebrew inscription,
using the Paleao-Hebrew script, is the Gezer Calendar
(<i>ca.</i> 900 B.C.).</p>
<p>We cannot know for certain the nature of the writing on the
tables, or tablets of the Law (Exod. 34:27-28). Moses, raised as
an Egyptian prince, probably knew both Egyptian hieroglyphs
and Akkadian cuneiform, and he may have learned to write in
an early form of the Hebrew alphabet as a result of contacts
with his own people. The Amarna texts have underscored the
fact that both Egypt and Canaan were highly literate during
the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries before Christ.</p>
<h3>Canaanite Glosses</h3>
<p>Of particular interest to language students is the fact that the
Amarna Letters frequently contain Canaanite words or expressions
which are inserted to clarify the meaning of the Akkadian
text, which was a foreign language to the scribe. These glosses
are our earliest examples of the language which became Biblical
Hebrew. While the language of Laban, and that branch of
Abraham&rsquo;s family which settled in northern Mesopotamia, was
Aramaic (cf. Gen. 31:47 where Laban uses an Aramaic name),
the Patriarchs who entered Canaan came to speak &ldquo;the language
of Canaan&rdquo; (cf. Isa. 19:18) which became the classical language
of the Old Testament. The cuneiform syllabary in which the
Amarna texts were written indicates vowel sounds which are
not expressed in the alphabetic Hebrew script. In this way
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
philologists are able to reconstruct some of the sounds of the
ancient language.</p>
<h3>Amarna Age Palestine</h3>
<p>Although the Amarna texts do not name any personage met
on the pages of Scripture, they are of value in helping us to
visualize life in the Palestinian city states during the middle of
the second millenium B.C. Biblical cities mentioned in the
correspondence include: Akko, Ashkelon, Arvad, Aroer, Ashtaroth,
Gebal (Byblos), Gezer, Gath, Gaza, Jerusalem, Joppa,
Keilah, Lachish, Megiddo, Sidon, Tyre, Sharon, Shechem, Taanach,
and Zorah. Beth-ninurta is thought to be identical with
Biblical Beth-shemesh.</p>
<p>These cities are, for the most part, independent city states,
owing allegiance to Egypt yet free to form their own alliances
and resolve their own local problems. It was this type of political
structure that Joshua met in Canaan. He waged war against
&ldquo;thirty-one kings&rdquo; (Josh. 12:24). At times these kings made
alliances in order to prevent Israel from gaining control of the
land, just as the Amarna Age rulers aided one another in resisting
Lab&lsquo;ayu. A leader against Joshua was Adonizedek, king
of Jerusalem, who found allies in Hoham, king of Hebron;
Piram, king of Jarmuth; Japhia, king of Lachish, and Debir,
king of Eglon (Josh. 10:1-3).</p>
<p>The military engagements were strictly limited affairs, judged
by the numbers of troops and horses requested of the Pharaoh.
Rib-Addi of Byblos pleaded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let it seem good to the lord, the sun of the lands, to give me
twenty pairs of horses.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his encounter with Abdi-Ashirta, the Amorite chieftain who
was seeking to control northern Syria in league with the Hittites,
Rib-Addi asked for but three hundred men.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></p>
<p>Abi-milki of Tyre indicated that he could get by with but
token help from Egypt. In one letter he asks for but twenty foot
soldiers,<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> and in another he will be satisfied with but ten.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a>
Somewhat earlier, in the Canaan of Abraham&rsquo;s day, the patriarch
was able to assemble an army of three hundred and
eighteen men (Gen. 14:14), pursue a confederation of five kings
with their armies, rout and chase the enemy. An entire garrison
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
might number but fifty men in the armies of Amarna Age
rulers.<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></p>
<h3>Affairs of Government</h3>
<p>The presence of a friend at the court was appreciated and
cultivated by the rulers of the city states. Several of the Amarna
tablets are addressed to an Egyptian official named Yanhamu
who bore the title &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s fanbearer.&rdquo; He was evidently a
man of considerable power, for the king entrusted him with the
issuing of supplies from a place known as Yarimuta. For this
reason the local princes in Syria and Canaan frequently wrote
to him. After outlining his needs, Rib-Addi indulged in a little
apple-polishing as he concluded, &ldquo;There is no servant like Yanhamu,
a faithful servant of the king.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
<p>Yanhamu seems to have occupied in the court of Amenhotep
III (and possibly Akhenaton as well) a position comparable to
the one Joseph held several generations earlier.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> Both Yanhamu
and Joseph were charged with overseeing the distribution of
food supplies (cf. Gen. 42:51-57). They both had Semitic names,
and the presence of Yanhamu in an Egyptian court during New
Kingdom times indicates that Semites were not barred from
government following the Hyksos expulsion. Rulers often find it
safer to trust faithful foreigners than some of their own subjects
who might be tempted to rebel.</p>
<p>The simple tastes of the Israelite tribes in the period before
the monarchy may be contrasted with the ostentation of Solomon&rsquo;s
harem with its thousand wives and concubines (I Kings
11:3) along with the wealth and luxury of an oriental court. The
rulers of the larger states of the Amarna Age, and particularly
Tushratta of Mitanni, sent their daughters to grace the harems
of Amenhotep III and Akhenaton. A scarab of Amenhotep III
commemorates the arrival of Giluhepa, a Mitannian princess
with a retinue of three hundred seventeen maidens.<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> That Amenhotep
III was actively building his harem is shown in a letter
which he addressed to Milk-ili of Gezer which says, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have sent Hania, the commander of the archers, to you with all
sorts of things, to bring the beautiful women.... There are in all
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
forty women; forty pieces of silver is the price of the women. Send
me therefore very beautiful women among whom are no slanderers,
so that the king, your lord, may say to you, &ldquo;This is fine.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The building of a harem had political implications for it involved
an alliance of friendship. Early in Solomon&rsquo;s reign he
&ldquo;made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh, king of Egypt; he took
Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter and brought her into the City of David....&rdquo;
(I Kings 3:1). A large harem, moreover, was a symbol of power,
wealth and prestige. Solomon was but adapting the customs of
the great rulers of the ancient East when he built an enormous
harem for himself.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
